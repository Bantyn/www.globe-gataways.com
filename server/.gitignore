# ========================================================
# NOTE FROM MR. PATEL:
# ➤ Please DO NOT remove or modify this file unless you 
#    understand the consequences.
# ➤ If you need to ignore new files, add them below the 
#    appropriate section or create a comment.
# ➤ Commit only clean and necessary code — not local configs.
